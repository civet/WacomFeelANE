#WacomFeelANE
================

Air native extension providing wacom stylus support and wacom multitouch support OSX.


##key bits (in the order to build them)
* as3-library/MaxOS-x86 -- the flashbuilder project for the wrapper.swc
* MacOS-x86/WacomFeelANE.xcodeproj  -- the thing that builds WacomFeelANE.xcodeproj. it cheats a little in that it manually includes the required FlashRuntimeExtensions.h.
* * the XCODE project calls the "build.command" script to rebuild the ANE on "Build for Archiving" 
* TestWacomANE -- trivial test app that traces the result of the call to the native extension
* do a "Cleanâ€¦" rebuild in Flash Builder 4.7 to pick up the latest build of the native side of your native extension
* (to pick up changes to the as3-side of your native extension you still have to quit flash builder as far as I can tell)


## to use the Native Extension 
* add the ANE to your project via the Native Extensions sub-tab of the project "Build Path" properties
* check the "Package" checkbox in the Native Extensions sub-tab of the project "Build Packaging" properties
* (and, yes, you can just reference the ANE from the place that the )

## TBD
* This will integrate cleanly into my "DeviceSupport" event-injection code once I'm successfully pulling data from the native side.
